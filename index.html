      <h2>Australian Mines</h2>
      <div id="vis1" class="vis-container"></div>



      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <p class="description-left">There are mines located in all states of Australia with 
          <span class="highlight-place">Western Australia, Queensland</span> and 
          <span class="highlight-place">New South Wales</span> having the most mines. 
          Both 
          <span class="highlight-place">Queensland</span> and <span class="highlight-place">New South Wales</span> focus on 
          <span class="highlight-type">base metals</span> and also <span class="highlight-type">coal</span>. 
          Whereas <span class="highlight-place">Western Australia</span> focusses on 
          <span class="highlight-type">gold, base metals</span> and <span class="highlight-type">iron</span>.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p class="description-right">
          We can also see that most mines in Australia are located near sources of <span class="highlight-type">water</span>, 
          including the <span class="highlight-type">ocean, rivers and lakes.</span> This is because mines require alot of water
           during the mining process. They will need water to seperate minerals, cooling machines
            and controlling dust. Due to the reasons stated above, mines are usually located near water sources.

    <h2>State Expenditures</h2>
    <div class="pure-g">

        <div class="description-right">
          <p> <span class="highlight-place">Western Australia</span> is the state with <span class="highlight-type">most expense</span>, 
            with Queensland and New South Wales alternating between 2 and 3. 
            This is because they have the <span class="highlight-type">most mines</span>. 
            Other than that, South Australia, Northern Territory and Victoria alternating 
            between 4-6 place. Lastly, <span class="highlight-place">Tasmania</span> 
            <span class="highlight-type">rank last</span> for expenses in every year. 
            This is due the small area and small number of mines available in Tasmania.
            So we can see the higher the number of mines, the higher the expenses.

            Each state focuses on different categories of minerals, with most of them having 
            <span class="highlight-value">3-4</span> different categories. 
            <span class="highlight-type">Gold, Base Metals, and Iron</span> are the minerals that have the highest expenditures. 
            This is possibly due to <span class="highlight-type">market demand</span> or availability of resources in those regions.

            <span class="highlight-place">Tasmania </span>and the <span class="highlight-place">Nothern Territory </span>.
            This trend is aligned with the states' rich resource deposits and mining infrastructure.

                The top section of the chart breaks down 
                the expenses across different minerals, showing how each category contributes to the overall expenditure. 
                Notably, <span class="highlight-type">Base Metals</span>, <span class="highlight-type">Gold</span>, and 
                <span class="highlight-type">Iron ore</span> have the largest shares of spending throughout the period. 
                Other minerals such as <span class="highlight-type">Mineral Sands</span>, 
                <span class="highlight-type">Uranium</span>, <span class="highlight-type">Coal</span>, and 
                <span class="highlight-type">Diamonds</span> occupy smaller portions of the total expenditures. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The bottom section of the chart provides a view of the <span class="highlight-type">total expenditures</span> 
                across all mineral categories. Although there are some variations, the overall trend suggests relatively stable 
                spending from <span class="highlight-value">2019 to 2023</span>.

            For the most years the actual mining exploration expenses exceeded the expected mining exploration expenses. The biggest difference was in <span class="highlight-value">2021</span> where <br>the amount exceeded was up to <span class="highlight-value">14% (442.9 Million)</span>. </br>

            However this is not true for the year <span class="highlight-value">2020</span>, where the actual expense was  <span class="highlight-value">lesser</span> than the expected expense. This is due to the pandemic that happened in 2020 which made the mining industry stop working during that time.

          <p>The <span class="highlight-type">possitive correlation</span> between expenditure and meters drilled is evident from the upward regression line, 
            indicating that as more money is spent,the more metres will be drilled. 
            This is because <span class="highlight-type">increased spending</span> is often associated with <span class="highlight-type">larger project</span> and more<span class="highlight-type"> drilling operations</span>.
            The data points are scattered around the regression line, 
            suggesting variability in the relationship between expenses and meters drilled. 
            This variability could indicate that 
            other factors (such as geography, type of mineral)
            may influence drilling output independently of expense.</p>
